# Breakout (Preview)

This repository gives a glimpse into a Breakout-style arcade game I helped develop as part of a group project during my computer science studies at the University of Copenhagen. The full implementation is private to respect academic integrity guidelines.

## About the Project

We built the game using the <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/DIKUArcade/tree/cb18385a95d1d345be829ad546c62eebd2188a3b">DIKUArcade game engine</a>, with a strong focus on clean software architecture and design principles. Our main goals were modularity, reusability, and clarity â€” both in code and gameplay experience.

## Key Features

- A custom state machine to handle game states like start, play, pause, and game over
- Core mechanics including ball physics, paddle movement, and block collision
- Special block types with effects and player rewards
- Scoring and level control system

## Technical Highlights

- Design approach: SOLID and GRASP principles
- Design patterns used: Factory Pattern, Publisher-Subscriber Pattern, and State Pattern
